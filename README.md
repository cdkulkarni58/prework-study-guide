# BootCamp  Prework Study for Front End web Development

## Description

This project is created as Study guide  for Bootcamp student. This project elaborates usage of various languages like JavaScript, Html, CSS and GTT under one visual studio platform.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-  Motivation for developing this project is to  learn usage of various languages as noted above along with effective use of GitHub which provides the platform that would make seamless updating on the program at the various stages by using branching the program What was your motivation?
-The Project was developed so as to understand and learn basic concepts and ideas behind front end web development and also to use global updating and modification of program using GitHub Why did you build this project? 

This pilot project elaborates  the usage of all the above languages along with two binders one is visual studio and other Github. By using these programs in combinations  a webpage can be developed that would be able to interact with the user by further improving javascript code- What problem does it solve?

This project development has provided the oppurtunity for new learner like me to understand and provided insight to  implement application of these various programs to apply and how to develope effective and efficient web applications - What did you learn?

## Installation

Various steps involved in the development are as listed below
a.open terminal on Mac machine
b.create a new folder on this machine by using command mkdir
c.Switch to the newly created directory by using cd command
d.download Github and create sign in of your name with the apropriate available email id on this website
e.create repository with some name to it 
f. Create SSH key from terminal  and copy this key to github repository This will enable flow of files to and from machine to github and vice a versa by pull and push commands
g.Now clone this repository to this newly created folder by  git clone command
h. download visual studio program  Unzip the folder and copy the file to application folder on your machine 
h. Now you are ready to go  Use available files provided in the prework study guide
i. Switch to newly created Github repository and crate new issues


What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
