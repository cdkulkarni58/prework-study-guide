# BootCamp  Prework Study for Front End web Development

## Description

This project is created as Study guide  for Bootcamp student. This project elaborates usage of various languages like JavaScript, Html, CSS with Github as a platform that allows branching that allows multiple users to work on same project simultanously.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-  The motivation for developing this project is to start and learn usage of various languages as noted above along with effective use of GitHub which provides the platform that would make seamless updating on the program at the various stages by using branching the program. Github is the palform which helps work on same project by multiple user by concept of branching  What was your motivation?
-The Project was developed so as to understand and learn basic concepts and ideas behind front end web development and also to use global updating and modification of program using GitHub Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This pilot project elaborates  the usage of all the above languages along with two binders one is visual studio and other Github. By using these programs in combinations  a webpage can be developed. This program is guideline of using various softwres as above to produce a webpage - What problem does it solve?

This project development has provided the oppurtunity for new learner like me to understand and provided insight to  implement application of these various programs to apply and how to develope effective and efficient web applications - What did you learn?

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
